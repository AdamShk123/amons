# A Matter of National Security

- 2D Platformer Shooter

Story
You play as a bored and depressed CIA agent who wants to waste his days away sitting on a beach during a sunset while sipping on a pina colada after his girlfriend broke up with him (ahem, it was mutual...), when you are called back into action!
You live to serve and will die for your country, damned be any terrorists and other malicious commie anarchists who dare jeopardize the safety of your homeland!
You are sent on individual missions to collect intel, steal it back, and kill any potential enemies.
Your boss and fellow agents are constantly disparaging and berating you for your incompetency, but you won't let that stop you from demolishing every meticulate plan devised by them and bringing absolute chaos.
